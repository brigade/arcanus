## 1.0.0

* **BREAKING CHANGE**: The format of the chest file has been changed
  to support encryption of arbitrarily-long values (previously there
  was a limit due to the algorithm used). To update to the new format,
  run `arcanus show` to get the decrypted chest YAML
  Edit `.arcanus/chest.yaml` and change its contents to `--- {}`. Finally
  run `arcanus edit` and paste the YAML file you previously exported.
* Remove internal `Configuration` class, as it was never used
  (results in no user-facing changes)
